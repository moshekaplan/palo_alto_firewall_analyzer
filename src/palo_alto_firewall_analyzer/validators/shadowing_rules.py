'''
Detects Shadowed rules

A rule is shadowed if it is preceeded by a broader rule
that would match all traffic that the rule would match.

For example, Rule 2 below would be a shadowed rule:

Rule 1:
Allow * to 192.168.1.0/24

Rule 2:
Allow * to 192.168.1.3/32

Some notes:
This implementation is very simple: It looks
for a single preceeding rule that is broader than a following rule. A more
intelligent algorithm would be able to combine all previous
rules and use a solver like Z3 to determine which combination
of previous rules would provide the same coverage as the shadowed rule.

It also doesn't resolve FQDNs, because their resolved address can
change and so that would lead to inconsistent results.

A future enhancement would be to also check IP ranges and subnets, so that
127.0.0.0/24 would also be detected as shadowing 127.0.0.1/32.
